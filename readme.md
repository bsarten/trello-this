Card this to Trello is a wrapper with some enhancements for Trello-Bookmarklet.

With this extension you can use to create a card in Trello from:

* FogBugz cases
* JIRA issues
* GitHub issues and commits
* The selected text from an arbitrary URL

It will walk you through a simple setup when first time you run:

* Authorize the site to interact with Trello
* Select the list that you'd like the bookmarklet to add cards too

The card created in Trello will attempt to:
* use the name of the FogBugz/JIRA/GitHub/etc case
* include a link to the case in the card description
* (optionally) include any selected text in the description. For JIRA it will add the ticket description if nothing is selected.
* add yourself to the members of the card

Some improvements:

* dropdown menu to select board/list
* no need to input API key for new site
* add right-click menu support
* native desktop notification support
* skip closed boards

You can install from it [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/llapjidoaciepmfjchefhhachlmehfdl)
